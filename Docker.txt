--- Commands for Docker
docker image: is a file used to execute code in a Docker container.image act as set of instruction to build a docker container 
like a template
Container:    is a runable instance of an image.

First pull an image and run container from that image.
docker pull ngix -- to pull an image
docker image ls
Now run container from that image
docker run -itd --name anycontainername nginx    -- run container in background (it meas run from console)
docker container ls                              -- to see running container 
docker rm containername                          -- to remove container
we cannot remove running container first stop container and en remove container
docker stop containername
docker rm -f containername                       -- forcefully remove container
docker container ls  
docker image ls 
docker rmi    nameofimage                           -- to remove image
docker rmi -f nameofimage                           -- to forcefully remove image
docker image ls 

-- directly run container without pulling
docker run -itd --name anycontainername nginx    -- it will first pull image and then run container
docker container ls  
docker image ls


-- Inspect logs
I can access container from browser with IP and port number
docker run -itd --name anycontainername -p 8081:80 nameofimage
docker logs    containerid / containername
docker inspect containerid / containername    -- it provides every detail of container
netstat -tulnps                               -- port 8081 is being used by local system.see which port is running
ip -a                                         -- this will get public ip address of system 65.21.244.121
now go to browser and type 65.21.244.121.8081 --  by this we can access our container from browser.
